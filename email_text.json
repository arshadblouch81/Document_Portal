They can verify by rolling the web service back to version 25.08.001. Between versions 25.08.001 and 25.08.002, the only change in the code is a single line in the Travel Claim function.In version 25.08.001, I hardcoded the line:s_NewBillingRate = 1In version 25.08.002, I removed this line and built a new release.It’s unclear how this one-line change could impact document fetching. However, it’s possible that some IIS server settings were modified after updating the web service source.

We still have some recipients coming through with the $1 pricing, I ran the scripts that we were given from Mansoor last fortnight, however these still appear to have the Bill amount issue. The services are $1.25, the special pricing is $1.25 however when entering the kms from the MTA it is $1 Mandy Richardson has the $1.00 in the MTA (26/06/25 test by Maddie entry) but when I enter through the timesheets screen it automatically has $1.25 (31/08/25) Amy Trout was showing as $1.00 when I entered the kms through the MTA, I added Special Pricing to see if this would amend the issue, it is now entering $1.00 through the MTA Thanks Maddie HardacreOperations Coordinator1800 133 123 P | 07 4453 0100 E | MadelaineHardacre@selectability.com.auHead Office, Level 1/131 Denham Street, Townsville, 4810 Queensland | ABN 27 174 635 449selectability is a proud member of the Queensland Alliance for Mental Health, National Disability Services, Mental Illness Fellowship of Australia and MI Networks Australia.The information contained in the above e-mail message or messages (which includes any attachments) is confidential and may be legally privileged.

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

The developer (demo) environment is designed for this kind of testing and should work for both local and public-facing environments.There are a few common reasons why the demo link might be failing:The public URL may not be listed in your app's redirect URIs in your Docusign developer settings.If the domain is using a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate, Docusign might block the redirect.Firewall rules or CORS policies in your cloud or server environment could also be interfering.To check, please log into your Docusign developer account at https://account-d.docusign.com, go to Apps and Keys, select your app, and confirm that your demo link is included in the list of redirect URIs.You don’t need a production account just yet, as everything should be fully testable in the demo environment.\"Kind regards,Dan On Tue, Jun 3, 2025 at 5:39 PM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have created App integration which is working for local host environment but not for demo link.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server. If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain. Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server. If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain. Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server. If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain. Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server. If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain. Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server. If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain. Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

Just wondering when you're catching up? As you know, we'd like Tim's advice (maybe screenshots/steps) on:how we can make Case and Op notes available to SWs in MTA App andhow to turn off emails triggered by Case Notes. This will help us implement Michael's recommendation from last week i.e. make Case and Op notes available so SWs record client observations in Case Notes (without email triggering). When deterioration is recorded they also complete an Op Note asking PCM to review the Case Note (the Op Note will then trigger an email to the PCM). I'm keen to get this done to get this in place asap as Nicole Hudson and Leonie Miller would like to release the new notes approach with the MTA App Upgrade, which is scheduled for late August. This way we'll be able to train the SWs on the new MTA App and the notes changes in the same sessions. Any update and help with this appreciated. I assume you, Michael and I are on Ekka leave tomorrow. I'll cancel tomorrow's ICT meeting and catch you on Thursday.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

After speaking with Lisa we have rolled back to the prior SSL Cert which gives us a little bit of time to investigate / take action should this reversal resolve the tablet access issues.Please let us know if MTA operable in this state. Chain of Cert 2024/2025 – Existing that expires this month Chain of Cert 2025/2026 – Cert replacement that was applied (now rolled back) PM of 6th Aug Kind regards, Shane SutherlandService Delivery Manager (03) 6364 3128136 Bathurst St, Launceston TASPO Box 1291, Launceston TAS 7250www.itresourcing.com.au From: Servicedesk@itresourcing.com.auSent: 7/8/2025 7:24:19 AMTo: \"'Guan Xiong Por (Paul)'\" , \"'Tim Watts'\" , \"'Jobs - Adamas Corporate Solutions'\" , \"'Julie Heady'\"Cc: \"'Mandy Williams'\" , \"'Fiona Enkelaar'\" , \"'Lisa Walsh'\" , \"'Arsha Abbas'\" , \"Shane Sutherland\"Subject: RE: URGENT: Critical Server Connection Issue with App Version 25.08.001 [ITR:0015942] Hi all, the SSL certificate was replaced yesterday afternoon to replace the soon to expire one.The replacement cert type and SAN/CN’s were the same the older one. Can confirm also per Pauls message that the site is accessible via web browser with valid SSL presented. No other changes made that we are aware of. Have also rebooted (just now) the IIS webserver that hosts the timesheet backend, can usage of the mobile app please be checked again, and if not working still we can revert to the older SSL (it has about 20 days left until expired) and then recheck to see if that resolves.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

The developer (demo) environment is designed for this kind of testing and should work for both local and public-facing environments.There are a few common reasons why the demo link might be failing:The public URL may not be listed in your app's redirect URIs in your Docusign developer settings.If the domain is using a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate, Docusign might block the redirect.Firewall rules or CORS policies in your cloud or server environment could also be interfering.To check, please log into your Docusign developer account at https://account-d.docusign.com, go to Apps and Keys, select your app, and confirm that your demo link is included in the list of redirect URIs.You don’t need a production account just yet, as everything should be fully testable in the demo environment.\"Kind regards,Dan On Tue, Jun 3, 2025 at 5:39 PM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have created App integration which is working for local host environment but not for demo link.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

The developer (demo) environment is designed for this kind of testing and should work for both local and public-facing environments.There are a few common reasons why the demo link might be failing:The public URL may not be listed in your app's redirect URIs in your Docusign developer settings.If the domain is using a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate, Docusign might block the redirect.Firewall rules or CORS policies in your cloud or server environment could also be interfering.To check, please log into your Docusign developer account at https://account-d.docusign.com, go to Apps and Keys, select your app, and confirm that your demo link is included in the list of redirect URIs.You don’t need a production account just yet, as everything should be fully testable in the demo environment.\"Kind regards,Dan On Tue, Jun 3, 2025 at 5:39 PM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have created App integration which is working for local host environment but not for demo link.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

Just wondering when you're catching up? As you know, we'd like Tim's advice (maybe screenshots/steps) on:how we can make Case and Op notes available to SWs in MTA App andhow to turn off emails triggered by Case Notes. This will help us implement Michael's recommendation from last week i.e. make Case and Op notes available so SWs record client observations in Case Notes (without email triggering). When deterioration is recorded they also complete an Op Note asking PCM to review the Case Note (the Op Note will then trigger an email to the PCM). I'm keen to get this done to get this in place asap as Nicole Hudson and Leonie Miller would like to release the new notes approach with the MTA App Upgrade, which is scheduled for late August. This way we'll be able to train the SWs on the new MTA App and the notes changes in the same sessions. Any update and help with this appreciated. I assume you, Michael and I are on Ekka leave tomorrow. I'll cancel tomorrow's ICT meeting and catch you on Thursday.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

If the server doesn't send the full chain, browsers often try to \"fill in the gaps\" using their own trusted root store or cached intermediates.But Android apps, especially on Android 13 and earlier, are much stricter:They require the full certificate chain to be sent by the server.If the server omits an intermediate certificate, Android can't validate the chain.Result: SSL handshake fails, and you get errors like javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException.

After speaking with Lisa we have rolled back to the prior SSL Cert which gives us a little bit of time to investigate / take action should this reversal resolve the tablet access issues.Please let us know if MTA operable in this state. Chain of Cert 2024/2025 – Existing that expires this month Chain of Cert 2025/2026 – Cert replacement that was applied (now rolled back) PM of 6th Aug Kind regards, Shane SutherlandService Delivery Manager (03) 6364 3128136 Bathurst St, Launceston TASPO Box 1291, Launceston TAS 7250www.itresourcing.com.au From: Servicedesk@itresourcing.com.auSent: 7/8/2025 7:24:19 AMTo: \"'Guan Xiong Por (Paul)'\" , \"'Tim Watts'\" , \"'Jobs - Adamas Corporate Solutions'\" , \"'Julie Heady'\"Cc: \"'Mandy Williams'\" , \"'Fiona Enkelaar'\" , \"'Lisa Walsh'\" , \"'Arsha Abbas'\" , \"Shane Sutherland\"Subject: RE: URGENT: Critical Server Connection Issue with App Version 25.08.001 [ITR:0015942] Hi all, the SSL certificate was replaced yesterday afternoon to replace the soon to expire one.The replacement cert type and SAN/CN’s were the same the older one. Can confirm also per Pauls message that the site is accessible via web browser with valid SSL presented. No other changes made that we are aware of. Have also rebooted (just now) the IIS webserver that hosts the timesheet backend, can usage of the mobile app please be checked again, and if not working still we can revert to the older SSL (it has about 20 days left until expired) and then recheck to see if that resolves.

Once installed, it will be available for use in the Traccs Cloud portal configuration.At present, the only SSL certificate in the IIS server is the one associated with the MTA web service, and no dedicated certificate exists for Traccs Cloud.We appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to your confirmation once the certificate has been obtained and installed. Yes - > In IIS, an SSL certificate can be used for more than one application if they share same domain like adamas.net.au, ingham.org.auFor different domain it requires different SSL certificate Regards,Arshad Abbas Arshad AbbasDEVELOPMENT MANAGERADAMAS CORPORATE SOLUTIONS From: Tim Watts <tw@adamas.net.au>Sent: Thursday, August 14, 2025 1:27 PMTo: Arsha Abbas <arshad@adamas.net.au>Cc: Julie Heady <julieheady@adamas.net.au>Subject: FW: INGHAM : CLIENT PORTAL Hi Arshad, Can you use Chatgpt or copilot to create an email with instructions on what needs to be done and send it to me please – so I can check with the ict if they can do it they are new/different to the ones that registered the original certificate For my info - so eah app has a separate certificate?

As you know it is only affecting certain devices. The one thing we did pick up on was that you are running on an old web service version if you can arrange to have this updated to the current web service version on our website ensuring the readiness script is ran at this time also. Then if you can have your staff remove the app completely from their phone and reinstall from AppStore and PlayStore. You will then be running latest versions of everything and should not face compatibility issues anymore.RegardsMelissa VorosADAMAS HELP DESKAdamas Corporate SolutionsPRIORITY: 1(Priority is 1-5 where 1 means day to day business cannot be continued.) : DESCRIPTION: Good Afternoon,Since June 2025 several of our staff have been unable to log onto traccs on the mobile app. As per the attached emails I have been in contact regarding this issue however it has not been resolved. I tried to set up one of our new users today on the app ( New Download and all ) and was not able to due to the same issue.

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

The developer (demo) environment is designed for this kind of testing and should work for both local and public-facing environments.There are a few common reasons why the demo link might be failing:The public URL may not be listed in your app's redirect URIs in your Docusign developer settings.If the domain is using a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate, Docusign might block the redirect.Firewall rules or CORS policies in your cloud or server environment could also be interfering.To check, please log into your Docusign developer account at https://account-d.docusign.com, go to Apps and Keys, select your app, and confirm that your demo link is included in the list of redirect URIs.You don’t need a production account just yet, as everything should be fully testable in the demo environment.\"Kind regards,Dan On Tue, Jun 3, 2025 at 5:39 PM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have created App integration which is working for local host environment but not for demo link.

Would it be something Commuserv maybe did when changing over our server 5 years ago and is this something that we should look at rectifying? Also, what is the update on cloud based and is this something we should be looking at? I have found how to view the tab for ‘shift reports’ in the recipient files and have sent an email around the office to discuss if we would like to change how we do things ongoing. This is the first time I have become aware that there was a tab for shift reports. Has this always been available?We currently only use service notes for payroll notes to write an explanation if they did not log on/ off at the correct times on the booking. We set things up this way as we believed that service notes could only be saved onto the actual bookings. We needed a record that would be sent to the coordinators and could be seen easily in the client file, hence client notes/ OP notes. I feel like we had discussed this reasoning at the time when you created the formatted service note version which did not work for us. I presume this is what you are referring to in the shift report layout, where they have to complete separate questions? As that was in service notes, not client notes, it did not suit our purposes (not knowing there was a tab for service notes) which is why we needed the formatted version deactivated. Now that we know that there is a service note tab and presuming theses notes can also be emailed, I presume this is how other agencies are managing these notes. How then are other agencies using service notes and client notes differently? Re: the archiving, this makes sense but the 27th July is not 14 days ago so there may be something wrong with our setting.

A few clarifications in light of your setup: If you do have a server in place, that's excellent—though based on your update path, it appears you may be running TRACCS in workstation mode rather than via Terminal Services. This means certain system-level files (not TRACCS program files) must be present and registered individually on each workstation.This usually happens once during installation, but very occasionally—perhaps once every five years—a new system file is required. That’s what occurred with RecipientsV2, so the registration task is a one-off, and unlikely to be needed again for some time. Notes VisibilityYes, the Shift Reports tab is available in the client record and can be enabled for desktop users via the user profile settings. If you're aiming to direct staff toward Service Notes/Shift Reports, you can enable this view in both desktop and app user profiles.That means:Notes entered via shift reports are stored separately from OP NotesThey're more structured and easier to locate laterSwitching may involve change management if users aren’t already familiarIf you're currently using OP Notes, the key setting to confirm is that app profiles are configured to use the OP Note layout instead of the Shift Report layout—this only affects what users see on their screens, not where notes are ultimately stored. Outlook Report ClarificationWith respect to Melissa’s comments on Outlook: she drew a reasonable inference based on a prior issue that did involve an update-related error. That said, in this case Syren’s description didn’t match that scenario—and I happened to notice it in real time. While Melissa has deep lived experience in both NDIA and aged care settings and is one of our most trusted helpdesk leads, no one person knows every edge case in TRACCS (myself included), so this was just an honest assumption. MTA History AutoarchivingOne of the recent releases introduced autoarchiving for MTA history to improve performance. By default, the MTA Dashboard now only loads:Completed services from the past 14 daysAny unapproved or unfinalized servicesThis helps reduce lag and load times. If you need access to a longer history window, we can adjust the threshold. That said, most finalized records are accessible via the Reports section, and ongoing use of MTA Dashboard beyond this window may slow system performance unnecessarily.Let us know if you'd like to amend the archive threshold or need assistance tweaking user profiles—we’re happy to walk through any adjustments. Warm regards, Tim Watts CEO Adamas Corporate Solutions From: Sophie McGinley <Sophie@balancehomeservices.com.au> Sent: Monday, 4 August 2025 10:10To: Tim Watts <tw@adamas.net.au>Cc: Julie Heady <julieheady@adamas.net.au>Subject: RE: Update issues Hi Tim, thanks for your response. I’m still a bit confused about a couple of things, particularly the comments about our setup. We do use a central server, and as far as I’m aware, we always have. That’s why I found it odd that Recipients 2 needed to be downloaded to each individual computer, since we all access TRACCS through the server. Based on that, our updates should be fairly straightforward as well.Regarding the reminders, it’s not a major issue, I just thought I’d flag it. I was just a little puzzled by the comment that it’s always been that way, as we only noticed the change after the recent update.To clarify the ‘shift reports tab’. Do you mean within each recipient’s file? We don’t seem to have that tab. When something is saved as a SRV NOTE, it only shows up on the booking, which is why we’ve needed those notes to go into OP notes instead. When I spoke to Melissa, she mentioned that in the version she tested, it was defaulting to OP notes, but that doesn’t seem to be happening on our end since the latest update.Another couple of issue Syren has identified. Emails cannot send from TRACCS from the new Outlook. Melissa responded to Syren’s query and stated, ‘I believe this has been resolved in current version of Traccs that is available on our website – 25.07.’ You have now responded this morning that this will not work and that we have to use the old outlook. The response from the support team that things will be resolved in an update, seems to be a common response but seems to often not be the case. Your response makes sense, regarding the update being cloud based and I don’t think we will be forced onto the new Outlook any time soon so this is ok, it’s just the inconsistent messaging. Syren has also this morning identified that she cannot access any bookings in MTA prior to the 27th July. I’m not sure what had changed there. Appreciate your help as we try to sort this out.Kind regards, Sophie McGinleyManaging Director6/202-208 Glen Osmond RdFullarton SA 5063P: 08 8338 3433F: 08 8338 3633sophie@balancehomeservices.com.auwww.balancehomeservices.com.au Are you happy with our service?

I completely understand how frustrating it can be when updates introduce unexpected issues, and I appreciate you taking the time to document them so thoroughly. I'll address each point below and clarify what has occurred, and where possible, what can be improved. Date Last WorkedYou're right—the “Date Last Worked” field was unintentionally removed from the staff filter list. Mansoor confirms this is now fixed, and a patch is scheduled for release next week to restore this functionality. I understand the inconvenience of needing to update again so soon, and we’ll aim to make the process as smooth as possible. RemindersTRACCS has always displayed all reminders unless filtered in each user’s profile. We’re not aware of any previous system-wide suppression setting, but I appreciate that your workaround with the dummy user helped in the interim. Mansoor’s solution is valid, though not ideal—we’ll explore if a more robust option is feasible in future updates. Service/Shift Notes vs OP NotesService/Shift Notes are preferred from a systems architecture perspective as they're accessible via the “Shift Reports” tab, and help organize content by service context. However, OP Notes can still be set as default per user profile, and both formats remain available in the client record. We’re not aware of any recent update that changed this default, but I’ve flagged it with the dev team to confirm. If the default has shifted unexpectedly, we’ll investigate why. Regardless, the ability to toggle between them remains—though I appreciate it’s cumbersome to rely on staff to do so manually.The visibility of notes left by other staff is tied to profile-level viewing permissions and should not have changed with the update. We’ll double-check that nothing was inadvertently altered. QR Code AccessThis issue typically stems from the readiness script not executing properly during web service updates. That script is standard across all clients, but whether it was run—or failed—by Commuserv is unclear. Our helpdesk did assist directly and I understand the QR functionality is now restored. Commuserv FeedbackThanks for passing on Paul’s observations. While our update process is deliberately simple—a 5-minute copy-and-run task—it’s significantly more difficult in setups like yours, where TRACCS is individually installed on each machine. This isn't a deployment model we usually support, and it unfortunately amplifies the complexity and risk of every update. Ideally, TRACCS would be hosted on a shared server, allowing all users to connect to a central instance. This would reduce update time dramatically and eliminate many of the configuration challenges you've encountered. Recipients v2Yes, Recipients v2 requires registration on each workstation under your current install model. In a server-based environment, this would be a one-time 30-second action. Spam filters are unpredictable, but I assure you the file Melissa sent is safe—it's deployed nationally, including with QLD Health and multiple councils. I’ll make sure the latest version is re-sent through an alternative method. App Update VisibilityYou're absolutely right—the timing of app updates on Play Store and App Store is opaque, and unfortunately out of our hands. Once we publish an update, it becomes visible based on each platform’s internal schedule. However, syncing your TRACCS desktop update with the latest app version typically ensures compatibility. Recommended ImprovementsTo simplify future updates and eliminate these hurdles, I strongly recommend transitioning TRACCS to a central server setup and allowing Adamas or Biztopia to manage updates directly. This change would:Eliminate workstation-by-workstation delaysReduce update time to ~10 minutes for desktop, ~15 for web servicesEnsure consistency and minimize manual errors Final NotesI fully acknowledge the Day Manager fault and confirm that it will be addressed in the next update.

Regards,Tim Watts Tim WattsCEOADAMAS CORPORATE SOLUTIONS From: Sophie McGinley <Sophie@balancehomeservices.com.au> Sent: Friday, 1 August 2025 12:42To: Tim Watts <tw@adamas.net.au>Subject: Update issues Hi Tim, I have not done an update for a while. We generally hold off as long as possible and don’t like doing updates as we find that every time we do, whilst some things may be fixed, others get broken, so I have an ‘if it’s working ok, don’t mess with it’ attitude towards TRACCS. There were a few things that I needed rectified however, and it had been a while, so I instructed Commuserv to do a desktop and app update. This time, on the desktop update. The date last worked on the previous staff filter list was removed. Mansoor says that is now fixed and there will be a new update next week. So, I guess we have to update again. Also, we started receiving all reminders when we logged on. This was fixed by creating a dummy ‘no reminder’ user but this just seems like a strange workaround to something that was not previously an issue. It was some app issues which was my main reason for updating. When the staff enter their client note, the system automatically is set to SRV NOTE instead of OP NOTE. We need these notes as OP Notes so that we can run reports of what was done on shift for Support Coordinators and other stakeholders relating to the client, and they get emailed to the coordinator to monitor all clients daily. I am not sure when it started defaulting to SRV NOTE or why there was a change when we had not updated anything, but we were finding that we were having to chase up many staff for not leaving client notes who then stated that they were, but it was being saved on the actual booking which is only accessible if you go and look for it. We have had to educate people to manually select OP note but as you know with people, this is a constant battle. Melissa advised that on the latest version, OP note was the default. After the update, SVR NOTE is still the default and now staff can see all of the notes that have been left there by other staff. This is something that we previously fixed after a previous update as we do not want them to see the other notes that are there. So, the issue we were trying to solve has not been solved and we now have another issue. Staff also initially after the update could not use the QR code to log on and off their shifts so we are going to have to manually approve many shifts from today which is very time consuming. In addition to this, Paul from Commuserv has had a huge amount of trouble following the instructions to update. He has told me that all of the instructions are very out of date and the process itself does not seem very advanced. He has had to spend a lot of time trying to work things out which included having to stop completely the first time he tried the desktop update as something seemed to go wrong. He was going to provide some feedback to you about this process. I am not sure if you are aware that we also cannot operate recipients 2. We tried and were communicating with Melissa about this at the end of last year, but it seemed to involve downloading some file to every individual computer and manually registering it? But when Melissa tried to send me the file, it was caught up in spam and would not release as it said it had a virus. I don’t know what the best way is to resolve this. I am just not sure why it is so difficult. I have always struggled with understanding all the various things that need to be updated and when, and why something always seems to go wrong when I do. The most confusing, is when to do the app update, which is the right version, and when it has been updated on the app store AND the playstore. There always seems to be some compatibility issues. Can some clearer and up to date instructions please be developed in relation to updates and their processes? I am also not sure why so many things seem to go wrong when updates are done but I hate doing updates for this reason. It always causes issues and time consuming work for us. I am not sure if there is any solution for that.

As you know it is only affecting certain devices. The one thing we did pick up on was that you are running on an old web service version if you can arrange to have this updated to the current web service version on our website ensuring the readiness script is ran at this time also. Then if you can have your staff remove the app completely from their phone and reinstall from AppStore and PlayStore. You will then be running latest versions of everything and should not face compatibility issues anymore.RegardsMelissa VorosADAMAS HELP DESKAdamas Corporate SolutionsPRIORITY: 1(Priority is 1-5 where 1 means day to day business cannot be continued.) : DESCRIPTION: Good Afternoon,Since June 2025 several of our staff have been unable to log onto traccs on the mobile app. As per the attached emails I have been in contact regarding this issue however it has not been resolved.

A unique one-time security token is generated and assigned to each user at the time of login through the MTA application. This ensures that only valid, authenticated sessions can access the API and retrieve data from the database. If still they feel additional security is needed or concerns remain, the system can be migrated to an isolated Virtual Machine (VM) environment to further enhance protection and reduce surface-level vulnerabilities.· Regards,Arshad Abbas Arshad AbbasDEVELOPMENT MANAGERADAMAS CORPORATE SOLUTIONS From: Tim Watts <tw@adamas.net.au>Sent: Tuesday, August 5, 2025 12:59 PMTo: Arsha Abbas <arshad@adamas.net.au>Cc: Julie Heady <julieheady@adamas.net.au>Subject: FW: TRACCS : IIS move Hi arshad, Can you comment on below? RegardsTim From: Tamara Dunn <tamara.dunn@adssilimited.com.au> Sent: Tuesday, 5 August 2025 15:45To: Tim Watts <tw@adamas.net.au>Cc: Julie Heady <julieheady@adamas.net.au>Subject: TRACCS : IIS move Hi Tim We have a known risk with the TRACCS IIS and have been looking at options to mitigate them further now that we are hosted in Azure.Our IT Host provider has come up with the below options. Are there any known TRACCS issues/impacts we ought to be aware of with either of the change options below should they be implmented? Current setup:The public-facing TRACCS mobile web app is hosted directly on the main SQL server that contains multiple production databases, including TRACCS.The app is accessible over multiple DNS names, multiple public IPs, and both HTTP and HTTPS. Key business risks:RiskImpactData breachIf the web server is exploited, attackers gain direct access to the core SQL server, potentially exposing client records, PII, or operational data.DowntimeAny compromise or issue with the web application could bring down the SQL server and multiple unrelated systems.Regulatory exposureHosting a public web app on a database server violates basic security hygiene and could be a breach of Essential Eight, ISO 27001, or client security policies.Reputation damageA breach or extended downtime could damage trust and cause unnecessary client churn or reputational impact. MitigationOptionDescriptionRisk CoverageUser ImpactContain Risk by Moving IIS to New ServerMove the public-facing web app to a new, isolated VM.

An interface should be provided in the Company Settings screen to allow configuration of the following: UPDATE Registration SET applyAcceptShift = 1, RosterAcceptanceInterval = 14; UPDATE Staff SET LastAcceptanceEndDate = '2025-05-20'; The LastAcceptanceEndDate field in the Staff table marks the starting point from which the Roster Acceptance feature becomes active for a care worker.The RosterAcceptanceInterval defines the number of days (e.g., 14) for which a care worker can accept published rosters starting from LastAcceptanceEndDate.For example:If LastAcceptanceEndDate is set to 20/05/2025 and RosterAcceptanceInterval is 14, then when the staff accepts the roster, the system updates LastAcceptanceEndDate to 04/06/2025.This means the staff has accepted rosters for the 14-day period from the initial date.The first time this feature is set up, LastAcceptanceEndDate must be manually defined. After that, the system will automatically update it through the roster acceptance process.You need to develop option in Traccs interface to enable feature and set RosterAcceptanceInterval Just set 2 bits from the interfaceApplyAcceptShift: To enable feature in appRosterAcceptanceInterval : Number of days for which staff can accept roster MTA Readiness script makes all necessary changes of fields, procedure and table in database Regards,Arshad Abbas Arshad AbbasDEVELOPMENT MANAGERADAMAS CORPORATE SOLUTIONS"

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

The developer (demo) environment is designed for this kind of testing and should work for both local and public-facing environments.There are a few common reasons why the demo link might be failing:The public URL may not be listed in your app's redirect URIs in your Docusign developer settings.If the domain is using a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate, Docusign might block the redirect.Firewall rules or CORS policies in your cloud or server environment could also be interfering.To check, please log into your Docusign developer account at https://account-d.docusign.com, go to Apps and Keys, select your app, and confirm that your demo link is included in the list of redirect URIs.You don’t need a production account just yet, as everything should be fully testable in the demo environment.\"Kind regards,Dan On Tue, Jun 3, 2025 at 5:39 PM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have created App integration which is working for local host environment but not for demo link.

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

The developer (demo) environment is designed for this kind of testing and should work for both local and public-facing environments.There are a few common reasons why the demo link might be failing:The public URL may not be listed in your app's redirect URIs in your Docusign developer settings.If the domain is using a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate, Docusign might block the redirect.Firewall rules or CORS policies in your cloud or server environment could also be interfering.To check, please log into your Docusign developer account at https://account-d.docusign.com, go to Apps and Keys, select your app, and confirm that your demo link is included in the list of redirect URIs.You don’t need a production account just yet, as everything should be fully testable in the demo environment.\"Kind regards,Dan On Tue, Jun 3, 2025 at 5:39 PM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have created App integration which is working for local host environment but not for demo link.

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

For testing in the demo environment, make sure the requests are going to https://account-d.docusign.com and not the production URL.If you're using JWT authentication, it’s also worth confirming that the public/private key pair matches what’s uploaded in your app configuration. Incorrect keys or certificate setup can cause silent failures.Also, depending on the OAuth flow you’re using, make sure all required parameters are included- like client_id, redirect_uri, scope, etc.—and that the scopes you’re requesting cover what the app needs (e.g. signature, impersonation).Lastly, if you're no longer testing on localhost and have moved to a hosted demo link, it's possible the domain is being blocked by browser settings or CORS restrictions.If you can share any specific error messages or what you're seeing when you try to test the integration, we’d be happy to help dig in further.\" On Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have configured the re-direct URLs.

The developer (demo) environment is designed for this kind of testing and should work for both local and public-facing environments.There are a few common reasons why the demo link might be failing:The public URL may not be listed in your app's redirect URIs in your Docusign developer settings.If the domain is using a self-signed or invalid SSL certificate, Docusign might block the redirect.Firewall rules or CORS policies in your cloud or server environment could also be interfering.To check, please log into your Docusign developer account at https://account-d.docusign.com, go to Apps and Keys, select your app, and confirm that your demo link is included in the list of redirect URIs.You don’t need a production account just yet, as everything should be fully testable in the demo environment.\"Kind regards,Dan On Tue, Jun 3, 2025 at 5:39 PM Arsalan Ali <aali@integratedliving.org.au> wrote:Hi Dan, We have created App integration which is working for local host environment but not for demo link.
